On a computer equipped with a Linux distribution.

- Compile the program with './makelin'

Then, you are able to run the shell script saillancepgm.sh as follows:

1 - Connection values based on components area :
./saillancepgm.sh Images/SH1.pgm 1 /tmp/resultat.pgm

2 - Connection values based on depth of components (dynamics) :
./saillancepgm.sh Images/SH1.pgm 3 /tmp/resultat.pgm

3 - Connection values based on volume of components :
./saillancepgm.sh Images/SH1.pgm 5 /tmp/resultat.pgm

4 - Connection values based on volume a variation of the work of
P. Felzenszwalb et al. (IJCV 2004)   Felzenswalb : 
./saillancepgm.sh Images/SH1.pgm 7 /tmp/resultat.pgm
